# LemonDB

## Introduction

A key-value database A simple key-value database by Lemonion. Inc.

See more information in our [official documentation](https://tc-imba.github.io/VE482-p2/)

## Compilation

### Debug
This version is used for debugging.
```
mkdir debug && cd debug
cmake ..  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make lemondb
src/lemondb
```

### Release
This version is used for performance test.
```
mkdir release && cd release
cmake ..  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make lemondb
src/lemondb
```

## Testing
For a small test case, just use the files under `test` folder. Set the working directory as `test`, set the program argument as `test.query` or `test*.in`.

The test cases are too bug, so they are stored with Git LFS. See more information on [Git LFS pages](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

Once Git LFS extension is installed, you can download the test cases through cloning the submodule:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Set the working directory as `testcase/sample`, set the program argument as `*.query`, simply start debugging!
(The loading query in all test files should be based on `testcase/sample` directory)

## Documentation

The working flow of LemonDB is written by ourselves.

The class / function documentation is generated by [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
